menuconfig SND_SOC_TAS256X
	tristate "Texas Instruments TAS256X SmartAmp(R)"
    help
      Enable the support for TAS driver.

      This is the main config under which various
      other configuration can be enabled based on
      the below configurations.

if SND_SOC_TAS256X
config TAS256X_REGMAP
    bool "Use of RegMap API"
    depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    help
      Enable support for TAS256X regmap driver.

      This includes i2c i2c driver structure,
      IRQ processing, registers read and write
      by i2c operations.

config TAS256X_CODEC
    bool "Codec Driver support"
    depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    help
      Enable support for TAS256X codec driver.

      This includes codec driver interfaces
      and functions and necessary functions for
      Linux Kernel ASOC Interface

config PLATFORM_EXYNOS
    bool "Exynos platform support"
    depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    default n
    help
      Enable support for Exynos platform.

      This enables the platform specific interface
      which acts as abstraction layer to the algorithm
      for Exynos platform.

config TAS25XX_ALGO
    bool "TAS256X Calibration Support"
	depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    help
      Enable support for TAS25XX Calibration driver.

      This includes TAS256X Calibration driver interfaces
      and functions also interfacing driver to corresponding
      Platform/DSP

config PLATFORM_QCOM
    bool "QCOM platform support"
    depends on TAS25XX_ALGO
    default y
    help
      Enable support for Qcom platform.

      This enables the platform specific interface
      which acts as abstraction layer to the algorithm
      for Exynos platform.

config TAS256X_REGBIN_PARSER
    bool "REG Bin File support"
    depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    default y
    help
      Enable support for REG Bin File.

      This enables the parsing of the binary file
      where the register settings can be stored and
      loaded to driver without the code modifications
      to the driver.

config TISA_KBIN_INTF
    bool "Kbin file method support"
    depends on PLATFORM_QCOM
    default n
    help
      Enable support for KBin file method

      This is the algorithm specific configuration
      where the binary file will be opened in the kernel
      using request_firmware API. This interface currently supported
      only on the Qualcomm platform

config CONFIG_TAS25XX_CALIB_VAL_BIG
    bool "For bigdata & calibration support"
    depends on SND_SOC_TAS256X
    default n
    help
      Enable support for bigdata & calibration.

      Enables the support for sysfs entries under
      /sys/class/tas25xx directory
      for calibration, validataion and bigdata

#config TAS2558_CODEC

config TAS256X_MISC
    bool "Misc Driver support"
    help
      Enable misc driver support.

      Enable the misc driver "tas256x" which is
      interface to communicate to device via register
      read and write
